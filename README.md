# Assignment 5 & 6

These two assignments will be completed and submitted at the same time. The two assignments are:

1. Install [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) into this Codespace repository using the method shown in class.
2. Using TailwindCSS classes only (no CSS) match the mockup provided as closely as possible.

To complete the assignment:

Using the method shown in class, you should follow the TailwindCSS documentation to install TailwindCSS into the assignment repository via Codespaces. Once you have verified that TailwindCSS is installed you should commit the changes and sync them.

Using the mockup provided at the root of the repository, try to recreate the card widget in the mockup using TailwindCSS classes **ONLY**. The only code in your CSS file should be the TailwindCSS directives from the installation. I have given you a folder named "assets" with all the images and icons you will need. You should aim to include **EVERYTHING** in the mockup in your HTML page. You should center the card in the page, exactly as it is centered in the mockup.

You will need to reference the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to find and use the classes needed. You may use Google and Stack Overflow if you get stuck, but do not use chatGPT and do not copy full blocks of code.
